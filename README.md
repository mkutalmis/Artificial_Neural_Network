# Artificial_Neural_Network
Classification of 2d data and visualization

In this program in step1 user chose data class count and for every class user chose a color for visualization.

In step2 user create neural network structure, input layer and output layer neuron counts set automatically,

10 for the input layer which is the size of a point(plus sign)

class count for the output layer every neuron represents a class for classification.

User sets the number of hidden layer and neuron count for each layer.

Then user pick activation function, cost function, learning rate and optimization method(SGD, BGD, Momentum, RmsProp, Adam)

In step3 user add points for each class to data space.

In step4 user either pick number of epochs and run program for that number or pick a epsilon value and run the network untill error less than epsilon value.

Learning run on a different thread so that If network can't reach that epsilon value and stuck user can stop.
